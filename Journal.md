# My-Internship-Journal




## Week1 and Week2


This journal is merely a part of personal experience working as an Intern at a top NZ media broadcasting company.

That company is going to launch a new STB(Set Top Box). Previously, the company had released several versions. This time they're going to release a smaller in size, lighter in weight but better and smarter version Set Top Box. In Asia, the device simply known as Android Boxes have been available in the market for quite some time. They're mainly used for streaming services such as  Amazon Prime, NetFlix and YouTube. That new STP is the combination of an old school pay tv box and an android box.    


The first week of the internship is mainly orientation, getting to familiar with the devices and systems being used.


Spend some time on the servers' stack. Learn how STBs are connected with the RedRat device manager.

Target=X-Y (it means it can be sent to all X to Y)

X is the first number of the target device and Y is the last number of the target devices. Y can be varied.

Target= A-A (only can be sent to A)

Target=B-B(only can be sent to B)

It shows the activity. rew-10= rewind for 10 seconds, ff-8= fastforward for 8 seconds, pause-10= pause for 10 seconds and so on. waiting time eg log in to YouTue, Netflix.



Checking process is done in accordance with step by step procedures.



Versions are also checked: App, Platform and Android.

Uptime is also checked.


Log capture is working. Basic commands are used such as sudo -s, #cd/var/log/XYZ/, #ls -ltr


If the log is not capturing certain commands needed to run; #cd/home/XA/XB/XC, #./adbconnect.sh



Android Debug Bridge ADB commands are also used.


Check the script. If it's not running, start the IR hub connected to RedRat devices.

#cd/home/XA/XB

# ./startServer_XYZ.sh


Run IR signal sending certain script

#cd/home/XA/XB/client/

#python runscript_DITL_XYZ.py

XYZDITL_3.txt


If the Uptime is the same no action needed.


If uptime is different, certain executions must be made.

If needed Recovery steps must be followed.


There're a lot of things that I've been doing but I'm not allowed to discuss due to the nature of the project I'm involved in. 

What's done in the workplace stays in the workplace because Vegas rules apply. 

As a newly graduate and a certified Cloud Practitioner It's an honour and privilege to be part of the team that makes a new product that will eventually be used by hundreds of thousands of households in the country. I've used it as a customer, and also studied how things are done as a networking student. I, however, never come closer like this. It's more like a military cadet parachuted into a World War II zone straight after finishing his training. Most people in the industry normally do daily routine work on a daily basis. I'm not saying this kind of work is boring. It's what most of us have to do. This is the reason why we're here. 

Nevertheless, most of them are creating new things to build a better world. That's why IT has changed a lot compared to the last 10 or 15 years. 

I just landed. I need to learn a lot. When I used to use facebook, even a short status that I wrote and posted got over a hundred likes and comments within 15minutes. Once I even had a post with 20K likes and 10K shares. In Github, your 10 followers is equivalent to 10K followers in other social media.

In Github or in this industry I'm nothing- a new old kid on the block. Yes, I used the term new old kid on the block because I studied IT and networking seriously at the age of 45. Even though most people welcome me with open arms I somehow still got mocked by a few because of my age. Do I care? If I cared about other people's opinions I wouldn't be here. Yesterday, I just polished my profile a little bit. My profile views count changed from one digit to two digits. It's scary. My first Github commit was my HTML files 15 months ago. There was a military coup in my motherland, I've been involved in some pro democrat activities. At night I was so scared and thinking that I'd get arrested at any time. I couldn't sleep so I started to learn some IT to keep my sanity intact. Having previously worked in Venture Capital before the military coup has been keeping me in touch with what's going on in the industry. It took a few hours to learn basic HTML and CSS. I made my first commit. But Web Dev bored me quickly so I stopped learning. Then I dabbled in Flutter and CRM Salesforce, and Python and Linux. But 3 months later I didn't even have time to scare and simply killed my time at night by learning Tech. I needed to get out of the country before I got exposed.



Long story short, I eventually returned to my adoptive country New Zealand in November,2021. I got a chance to acquire AWS re/Start Micro-Credential at Unitec. My classmates only needed to concentrate, focus and study during the course. But I had to go through mental and physical hardship first before I even thought about studying. Physically, I became a handicapped as well. At that moment I fully understood and had more empathy for handicapped i.e they had to put a lot of effort into what normal people do daily routine and tasks at ease. Human spirit is more like a computer program. Well written bugs free code executed well and gives a good result but you can't see how it runs through cpu and network. With strong desire and determination the human spirit can overcome any hardship. I thought I would dropped out the course half way through but I completed. I'm the first to passed CCP exam not because I was smart simply because I took it the earliest. I dared it too. Of course, I've to thank my lecture, and also some of my classmates. My classmates were also awesome and friendly people. I'm now studying Diploma in Cloud Engineering (Level 7) part time- two year programme.

I'm surprised that my new class classmates hardly talked to each other. My re/Start class was awesome. We not only talked each other but also exchanged words, notes and links in the chat while following the lecture in daily basis. I miss my old class. This is what real networking is all about. 

Today's the end of my mid internship. I only have two more weeks to do.

What have I learnt so far?


1. Adapt quickly

Before I left my mother land, I had been Mac OS user. All my devices such as phones (I had 3 phones) , tablets and PCs were run on macOS & iOS. I didn't even remember the last time I used Windows, probably Windows XP nearly two decades ago. At work I was given HP laptop and I was struggling a bit to get used to Windows. Within 15 minutes I got judged instantly. Next morning, I had to show up with using Windows at ease.

This is a tiny small example for an intern. A newbie in the industry must prepared to learn new software, new firmware, new thing, new language, new device very quickly. Or change the career. 

2. Communication, Communication, Communication.


3. Clarification is also important. If it's uncertain just ask.

4. Theory and Practical may vary sometimes. 

Sometimes, doing practical for one hour is the equivalent of studying for weeks and vice versa.



What's next? What will be happing in the remaining part of my internship. One sure thing: exciting things await.
